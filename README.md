# keyboardSwitcher

`keyboardSwitcher` is a command-line tool designed for macOS that allows you to list, show, and switch between different keyboard layouts effortlessly.

## Available Commands

- **list:** List all available keyboard layouts.
- **enabled:** List enabled layouts (those configured in System Preferences).
- **select "\<layout\>:** Set the current keyboard layout.
- **get:** Retrieve the currently active keyboard layout.
- **version:** Print the version of `keyboardSwitcher`.

## Limitations

To successfully execute the "select" command, the desired keyboard layout must be added in the macOS Settings app under Keyboard > Sources.

## Possible Usages

For example, you can dynamically switch the keyboard layout based on the connection status of a Bluetooth keyboard or use an Alfred workflow for quick layout changes.
